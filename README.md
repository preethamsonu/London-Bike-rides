# London-Bike-rides
-The data set I have used is the London bike rides dataset.
-I have used Python to download the data set from Kaggle extracted it and made some changes.

-Here are some of the insights I have found from the visualization.
## 1. Ride Frequency Over Time
Insight: The data shows a clear seasonal trend with bike ridership peaking in the summer months (June to August) and declining during the winter (December to February). Weekdays also see more ridership compared to weekends, indicating a strong commuter base.
2. Impact of Weather on Ridership
Insight: There's a noticeable drop in ridership on rainy and colder days, with optimal riding conditions occurring when temperatures are moderate (15-20°C) and there's no precipitation. This indicates that bike usage is weather-sensitive.
3. Peak Hours for Bike Rides
Insight: The data highlights distinct peaks during typical commuting hours—8 AM to 9 AM and 5 PM to 6 PM. These peaks suggest that many users rely on bikes for daily commuting, particularly during rush hours.
4. Rides by Day of the Week
Insight: Weekdays (especially Tuesday through Thursday) show significantly higher ridership than weekends. This suggests that bike-sharing is primarily used for commuting, with less emphasis on weekend recreational rides.
5. Seasonal Trends
Insight: Rides peak during spring and summer, while winter shows a significant decline. Additionally, public holidays like Christmas and New Year’s Day see a sharp drop in bike usage.
